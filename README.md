Week #14 Bootcamp Challenge - Repo for Chris Kilkes' Module #14 Data Analytics Bootcamp repository challenge - Chris Kilkes 05/13/24 @ 6:30 pm PST

# What the project does: 
Enables you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. Using the dynamic web-hosted site you are able to select specific test subjects included in the dataset to examine both the top OTUs as well as the visualize their prevalence for that subject within their associated test results.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# How users can get started with the project: 
Download, run analysis and evaluate results for self. Code allows for creation of a dynamic website allowing for selection of individual test subjects and visualizing their analysis results for this project allowing for the requested analyses from Belly Button Biodiversity dataset for themselves (or repurpose for similar analytics projects using similar approach but utilizing a different dataset). 

# Resources used for building SQL project include:
Multiple sources such as: I referenced official Bootcamp course material and documentation; instructor teaching (classes & shared resources), aid from fellow students, Google Search, StackOverflow, W3C Schools, content as well as support and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
